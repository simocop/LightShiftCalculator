# LightShiftCalculator
MATLAB code to calculate light shifts in Rb87, as described in https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-25-26-32550. 

Top-level file is "dual_light_shift_1560_1529.m". Running this file will generate the calculated data needed to make the figure in the paper showing light shifts of the 5P3/2 levels vs. 1529.269 nm light intensity. 

Any questions/comments/criticisms most welcome at simocop at gmail dot com.
